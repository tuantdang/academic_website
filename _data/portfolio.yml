  image: tp7hw2.jpg
  description: A touching based Teaching Pendant that is used to teach robot works. It written in C++ with hardware powered in pure Linux (kernel only, without GUI likes Ubuntu or Fedora,...). The project's challenge is to re-create GUI from scratch on the top of Linux system call. This is because TP7 uses low-end CPU and need to reponse to quick user's behaviors. It also supports 3D view under OpenGL ES 3.0 core profile API.
